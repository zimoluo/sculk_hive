# Sculk Hive

## Notable Features
* A New Sculk-themed boss added to Minecraft 1.19.
* Fairly hard challenges with a unique item loot.
* Exhiliarating visual and sound effects.
* Lores that are surely charismatic.
* Prepare to battle with Sculk Hive!

## Sculk Hive
* A deadly monster that spreads to wherever it encounters.
* Deploys colonizing catalysts to aid in its domination.
* Awakes undead soldiers, the soulless bodies devoured by the hive's ancient conquering.
* Calls up Wardens to fight alongside.
* Becomes enraged after taking considerable damage.
* Pushes its last resort to desperately strike down the intruder.

### Summoning
* The boss randomly appears underground or in ancient cities. When an altar-like structure is found, complete the building by placing a sculk shrieker on its top and igniting all four soul sands to initiate the summoning.
* After the altar is complete, darkness starts to surround you and the boss gradually transforms into its full state. Note that the health bar is charging up.
* Disposing of the Sculk Sword will also create an incomplete altar.
* Manually constructing the altar to summon the boss is impossible.

### Attacks
* The boss is divided into three phases, each featuring different yet related attack forms.

#### First Phase
* In the first phase, the boss doesn't actively attack for much, but instead focus on spreading itself.
* When the player remains stationary - that is, to stand still - for too long, the boss conjures fangs toward the player and shoots sonic blasts.
* When the fight has progressed for awhile, the boss casts necromancy spells to bring back those dead.
* Watch out for the Wardens aroused by those sculk shriekers.
* Becomes enraged when the four catalysts surrounding the boss are all beaten while there exists other catalysts; in this case, the boss quickly colonizes the arena with its sculks.
* Turns to the second phase when all catalysts are beaten. If the only catalysts beaten are all the four starting catalysts, the boss directly transforms to its final phase.

#### Second Phase
* Upon entering the second phase, the boss recharges its strength in preparation for a more ruthless attack.
* The boss continues to summon undead warriors, with the only exception being horsemen spawning more frequently.
* Detecting an enemy nearby, the catalysts - now 'sentries' - shoots stronger sonic blasts to them.
* When all sentries are knocked off, the boss enrages, entering its final phase.

#### Final Phase
* The final phase demonstrates the boss's last resort of taking down its intruders. Again, the boss bar - turning red - recharges to maximum.
* The boss's sheild blows up, so now you can attack the boss itself.
* The boss shoots two super sonic blasts followed by a super sonic boom toward all its targets in range.
* Whenever a Warden is awaken, it becomes a spirit and flies toward the boss to recharge its health.
* Undead army no longer emerges from the ground.
* When the boss's health depletes, it loses all its powers and explodes. All negative effects will be removed, and warden will no longer be spawning in the vicinity.

### Death
* Upon its death, the boss leaves a portal-like structure with a loot chest on the top. All the players within a 32-block range are given an advancement.
* The chest contains loot similar to that in ancient cities, but with a unique loot: the Sculk Sword.

### Loot
* The Sculk Sword is the loot from the boss. Forged and enchanted with the Sculk Hive's remnant souls, the mighty sword swears its faith to the first one who wields it.
* Immune to most damage sources, the Sculk Sword is more durable than nether star and netherite swords.
* Declaring its loyalty to its only master, the sword refuses to and curses those that dare to pick up the sword.
* If thrown by its master, the sword revenges the betrayal by turning into the Sculk Hive's altar.
* Aside from the Sculk Sword, the player receives a remarkable amount of experience that guarantees at least a level from 0 to 20.

## Technical Details
* The boss can only be summoned when no other Sculk Hives are present in the world.
* When attempting to resummon the boss with the Sculk Sword, one must make sure that no other functional altars are within 128 blocks range.
* The boss's attack range is 32 blocks, and the boss's despawning range is 128 blocks. When there are no players (including spectators) within 128 blocks, the boss despawns.
* The boss attacks all mobs except the Ender Dragon, Ghasts, and Wardens. For players, the boss only attacks players in survival or adventure mode.
* When the boss despawns, it can be resummoned at its altar; however, the boss cannot be summoned at its original site if it's defeated.
* The datapack names all its scoreboard objectives and tags with the prefix `sh_`, so it's compatible with most other datapacks.

## Lore
* I appreciate you reading all the way to the lore section - the one I believe to be the most interesting.
* Sculk Hive is the very source of the deep dark biome and all the sculk blocks. Originated from the souls filled with hatred, the boss ceaselessly spreads itself to everything it encounters. It has been said that the Wardens were amongst the first creations of the boss, built to protect its creator. Out of the very fear, the underground miners constructed the ancient city to worship the Wardens. Tens of thousands of years went by, the boss, creating the deep dark biome of the entire world, rests to its dormant state - until the player wakes it again. Fueled by the souls, the boss emerges after absorbing four blocks of soul sand - what believed to be condensed with souls, powerful in souls, powerful enough to support a Wither, and, of course, the Sculk Hive. Rising from the long sleep, Sculk Hive attempts to once again conquer its surrounding landscapes, only to be interrupted by the intruders. In an attempt to eliminate all its potential threats, it calls up the dead ones submerged deep underground, belonging to those once devoured souls. Sculk Hiveâ€™s vain attempts will be ultimately proven unsuccessful, as the player strikes down all its catalysts. Aiming to defeat the dangerous threat, the frightening boss draws its soul power to fully charge itself, attacking the player. Wardens also return to their spirit forms to heal the Sculk Hive. However, the boss is eventually destroyed by the player, forging its remaining souls into the Sculk Sword, waiting for the day to avenge. It becomes only when the player throws the sword away that the desperate sword once again becomes the parts of Sculk Hive in seek of avenge.
